    "Sleep is one of the most important and necessary parts of our everyday routine, playing a critical role in helping us maintain cognitive function, brain health, memory, mood, emotional regulation, and overall well-being. It plays a vital role in the human health as a whole, allowing the brain to reset itself, remove accumulated toxic byproducts, and adjust neurotransmitter levels, enhancing learning by forming new neural connections and problem-solving abilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "An emerging concern associated with sleep quality is the link between sleep and neurodegeneration, the loss of neurons connected with various behavioral impairments. More generally, neurodegeneration can be seen as the progressive loss of neurons and functionalities. Sleep and sleep quality has become increasingly intertwined and linked to neurodegenerative diseases because of its large impact on brain functionality and regulation. For example, analyses have found that insomnia elevates the risk of all-cause dementia, especially when occurring with a major depressive disorder (MDD). This leads to our main research question: How much of an impact does sleep quality have on the likelihood of developing neurodegenerative disease or other similar health effects? According to studies, having a persistently short sleep duration at ages 50 to 70 compared to persistent normal sleep duration was associated with a 30% risk increase in dementia. This was independent of sociodemographic, behavioural, cardiometabolic, and mental health factors as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of prior work done on this topic of sleep and neurodegeneration is pretty extensive as studies on our sleep and sleeping habits have a long and storied history. In the past few decades, researchers have made extensive progress on the study of sleep and its effects on all parts of the human body. Recently, researchers have recognized and identified sleep quality as a potential risk factor and symptom of neurodegeneration. However, many aspects of this relationship are still being studied presently and new data and relationships are being found.\n",

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to give out a survey to students at UCSD or other adults, we would ask for their consent on whether or not they would like to give out personal details such as how much sleep they have had or any history with neurodegenerative diseases. A consent form for each of the surveys would ensure that we are not collecting personal information from people who would not like to share it to the public. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for biases within the data we collect, we will collect from a multitude of sources and validate the contents of the data collected within each source. If a source does not meet our threshold for the amount of data we need to be able to do effective analysis, then we will not utilize it in our predictions. Additionally, we will attempt to account for any factors such as demographics within the data we collect so that our outcomes are more representative of the entire population. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " If we were to collect data from surveys we send out to other students, then we would make the effort to keep the personal information as anonymous as possible so that we could control for factors such as race, gender, or any other determining factors. We will only collect relevant data that helps us answer our research question.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    " All data collected and the analysis done to this data will be freely available to our entire team and the course staff. It is up to the course staff’s discretion on whether our project and its contents are able to be seen by third parties. As our main sources of information are found through the internet, the data has already been made publicly available, so we are only sharing information that has already been shared by other projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have considered the possibility of biased data and we will try to guarantee that we will not view data with prior assumptions, instead we will validate the results alone and make informed predictions about how such data could apply to our goals for the project. To address these biases, we will also be mindful of where our sources come from and also focus only on variables necessary for our project. On the issue of stereotype perpetuation, we will examine our data carefully so that we are not merely looking for causality, but instead taking into account the nuances of degenerative disorders and the people who experience them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    " Our graphs and visualizations will be as clear and data driven as possible. We will attempt to minimize the likelihood of our visualizations implying a message that our group did not intend to convey. Underlying data will be explained to ensure that each visualization can not be misinterpreted. We will emphaisize that correlation does not indicate causation and some visualizations will only be serving the purpose of showing relationships between variables and should not be considered as our conclusions about the data being observed. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " We will practice tidy data and clean data wrangling to focus our efforts on the data that directly coincides with the goals of the project. We will omit any data that does not directly affect or relate to the variables we will be analyzing. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    " Our data process will be thoroughly documented which will allow anyone in the future to view our project and validate the results of our analysis. Every step from the data wrangling to the visualizations, to all the issues we faced will be written down to describe every process we went through to arrive at our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    " Our analysis focuses on sleep-related metrics (ex: sleep duration, sleep apnea events, sleep quality, REM sleep behavior) and clinical data. Using this, and being cautious about including demographic data that could be representative/ a proxy for certain protected characteristics, our goal is to ensure that any predictive power comes from biological and behavioral factors directly related to sleep and health and not from variables that might introduce societal biases like demographics, ethnicity, age groups, generations, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    " With our dataset containing demographic information such as age, sex, or race, we plan to evaluate our model’s performance across these different subgroups, but we will check for disparities like false positive and false negative rates in these key metrics to test the model results for fairness with respect to different demographically affected groups to ensure the predictive analysis has no basis on it. And if our model is significantly less accurate for one compared to another group, in our final report we would document and record this disparate rate and discuss its potential implications on ethics and fairness, even if we can’t fully mitigate it because of its training and ingrained biases systemic in the variables’ relationships within the scope of the project. And another question is evaluating whether or not the model is better with or without those ingrained metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    " Predicting the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, we won’t rely solely on accuracy as our primary metric, and we will prioritize metrics accounting for the cost of incorrect predictions to optimize for considering the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics with model optimization impacts. Specifically focusing on sensitivity (ability to correctly identify individuals at risk) and specificity (ability to correctly identify individuals NOT at risk) and highlighting the trade-off between the two will help us aim for a balance that avoids incorrect metrics like high false positives with an alarm and missing potential cases like high false negatives too as an additional metric to show effects of model optimization and when it comes to an overextent. We will also consider additional metrics like the F1-score and AUC-ROC and other ML metrics to get a more sophisticated and comprehensive view of model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    " Starting with simpler, more transparent models like logistic regression or decision trees to establish a baseline and understand the key predictive features helps with model interpretability before getting into obscure algorithms. Using more complex black-box models like gradient boosting, DL, neural networks, if we plan to employ these types of corresponding techniques to analyze feature importance and explain the model’s predictions then a justification will definitely be more needed because the model isn’t as clear in its results and understandable terms for a decision so more explanation is needed. As a health-related topic, being able to explain why the model made a certain prediction at all times is crucial for trust and understanding in results though. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    " In our final report and presentation, we will definitely dedicate specific sections to discuss the limitations of our model and tradeoffs. Including any known biases, demographic-based ingrained predispositions, and flaws in our source data, we can show performance trade-offs we had to make and give a clear statement into what our model identifies as correlations and not casual or misconstrued relationships. Approaching it from an educational and exploratory purpose and perspective also helps in showing the applicability of it to clinical and diagnostic real-world situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    " Our evaluation will consist of testing the model’s data on various more training datasets even after deployment to identify skews in performance execution and see if the model is still working to its fullest capacity. The final performance at the analysis and report will be documented thoroughly, and ongoing monitoring with active predictions can be made using another algorithm to match its predictions from a different approach to uncover any biases that might arise from data changes or incorrect errors as a result too. Having robust evaluation metrics for regular audits and performance monitoring and human review and future impact and biases concept basis through evaluating accuracy, understanding sensitivity tradeoff between false positives and false negatives, maximizing recall (minimizing false negatives) in settings, prioritizing at risk individuals, and also evaluating using the F1-score harmonic mean, other model metrics, and the AUC-ROC curve to compare performances across all thresholds, also cross validation, error analysis, peer review and more are all important for post deployment challenges and model auditing.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    " A mechanism for user harm and a formal redress process include meetings with the primary stakeholders, evaluating product goals and concept drift, insurance policies, and if errors are found in our analysis or conclusions from investigations after user harm, the redress plan will involve acknowledging these mistakes, understanding what went wrong, and documenting the correct approach, fulfilling the educational objective of this mistake, and compensating injury in any medium necessary, all preventing future harms through re-investigation of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    " For rolling back in a live production environment, the stakes are much higher, requiring planned, systematic approaches to minimize disruption. An immediate and reliable rollback mechanism is critical. If the new model starts making erroneous predictions, we can instantly switch traffic fro a poorly performing new model back to the last known stable model version using version control on github from our updates. This ensures the final product can always revert to one free of biases and without erroneous error disparities and harmful results. Shifting production traffic quickly is the perfect solution for this issue in ethics and deployment environments. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    " The main foreseeable unintended use and consequence would be misinterpreting our model, used for educational purposes and with its idea having no harm inherently, and its findings as medical advice, as it is educational and experimental only and hasn’t been tested on the medical stories and complexities of health issues in all types of patients despite demographic testing it can’t process a multitude of variables and link them at a time like two different diseases, etc. Stressing the correlational (and possibly more to determine and uncover true relationships that exist) nature of our findings and the model’s limitations to discourage misuse and that correlation does not imply causation in our specified conclusion should be the steps we take the identity and prevent unintended uses and abuses of the model and monitoring it as such after deployment with disclaimers and more factors.\n"
