# Data Wrangling & Data Product (DSC 80)

## Objective
Design and implement an end-to-end data workflow that acquires real-world data, cleans and validates it, and produces an analysis-ready dataset and user-facing data product.

## Data
- Real-world dataset(s) used in the DSC 80 final project.
- Data acquired from external sources and characterized by missing values, inconsistent formatting, and validation challenges.

## Methods & Skills Demonstrated
- Data acquisition and ingestion from raw sources
- Data cleaning, normalization, and schema validation
- Feature construction and reshaping for analysis
- Modular code organization for reproducibility
- Creation of a final deliverable (report and/or lightweight website)

## Results
- Produced a clean, structured dataset suitable for downstream analysis.
- Validated data integrity through systematic checks and exploratory summaries.
- Delivered a final data product demonstrating the cleaned data and key insights.

## Artifacts
- `notebooks/` — exploratory and validation workflows
- `src/` — reusable data processing utilities
- `site/` — final data product (if applicable)
- Project report (PDF), if included

## Notes
This project emphasizes data engineering fundamentals and reproducibility rather than predictive modeling.
