# Sleepiness & Health Indicators Analysis (COGS 108)

## Objective
Investigate relationships between sleepiness-related measures and demographic or health indicators, and evaluate whether these variables support baseline predictive signals for identifying high-risk or diagnostically relevant groups.

## Data
- Observational, tabular dataset used in the COGS 108 final project.
- Includes demographic variables (e.g., age) and sleepiness-related measures (e.g., Epworth Sleepiness Scale).
- Outcome variables used for group comparison and baseline classification tasks.

## Methods & Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missingness and inconsistent entries)
- Exploratory data analysis (distribution analysis, correlation matrices, group comparisons)
- Feature inspection and baseline modeling workflow
- Visualization for diagnostic and interpretability purposes
- Clear communication of findings through figures and structured notebooks

## Results
- Identified meaningful correlations between sleepiness measures and selected demographic/health variables.
- Group-level differences highlighted through distribution and correlation visualizations.
- Baseline models established reference performance for classification-style tasks, serving as a foundation for future model refinement.

## Artifacts
- `notebooks/` — full analysis workflow from proposal through final submission
- `images/` — correlation matrices and diagnostic plots
- `results/` — saved outputs used in reporting

## Notes
This project emphasizes analytical reasoning, data validation, and interpretability rather than model optimization.
