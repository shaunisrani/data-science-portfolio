# Sensor-Based Time-Series Analysis (DSC 96)

## Objective
Analyze sensor-derived data to characterize temporal structure, identify meaningful signal patterns, and support interpretation relevant to monitoring or diagnostic contexts.

## Data
- Sensor measurements provided as part of DSC 96 coursework.
- Time-indexed or sequential observations representing physical or environmental signals.

## Methods & Skills Demonstrated
- Time-series preprocessing and signal inspection
- Feature extraction from sensor signals (e.g., summary statistics, temporal patterns)
- Diagnostic visualization for understanding trends, variability, and anomalies
- Analytical reasoning focused on interpretability rather than black-box prediction
- Clear written communication of methods and findings

## Results
- Identified interpretable temporal patterns in sensor measurements.
- Extracted signal characteristics relevant to the problem context.
- Presented results through figures and narrative analysis in a structured report.

## Artifact
- `DSC 96 sensor1_analysis-project (4).pdf` — final project report containing methodology, figures, and conclusions

## Notes
This project emphasizes signal understanding, feature reasoning, and interpretability over end-to-end model deployment.
