# Sensor / Time-Series Analysis (DSC 96)

## Objective
Analyze sensor-based data to identify structure over time and extract interpretable signals relevant to monitoring, diagnostics, or event detection.

## Data
- Sensor measurements provided as part of the DSC 96 coursework.
- Time-indexed or sequential observations analyzed as a time series.

## Methods & Skills Demonstrated
- Time-series preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Feature extraction from sensor signals
- Diagnostic visualization for temporal patterns and anomalies
- Interpretation of results in a reporting context

## Results
- The attached report presents the full analysis, figures, and conclusions.
- Key results include identified temporal patterns and signal characteristics relevant to the problem context.

## Artifact
- `DSC 96 sensor1_analysis-project (4).pdf` — final project report
