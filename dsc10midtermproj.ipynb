    "Welcome to the Midterm Project! Projects in DSC 10 are similar in format to homeworks, but are different in a few key ways. First, a project is comprehensive, meaning that it draws upon everything we've learned this quarter so far. Second, since problems can vary quite a bit in difficulty, some problems will be worth more points than others. Finally, in a project, the problems are more open-ended; they will usually ask for some result, but won't tell you what method should be used to get it. There might be several equally-valid approaches, and several steps might be necessary. This is closer to how data science is done in \"real life.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you **start early** on the project! It will take the place of a homework in the week that it is due, but you should also expect it to take longer than a homework, and you want to leave time to get help in [office hours](https://dsc10.com/calendar/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are especially encouraged to **find a partner** to work through the project with. If you work in a pair, you must follow the [Project Partner Guidelines](https://dsc10.com/project-partners/) on the course website. In particular, you must work together at the same time, and you are not allowed to split up the project and each work on certain problems. If you work with a partner, only one of you needs to upload your notebook to Gradescope; after uploading, you'll see an option to add the other partner to the submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch basic mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). Directly sharing answers between groups is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid looping through DataFrames unless instructed to do so.** Loops in Python are slow, and looping through DataFrames should usually be avoided in favor of the DataFrame methods we've learned in class, which are much faster. **Please do not import any additional packages.** You don't need them, and our autograder may not be able to run your code if you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through this project, there are a few resources you may want to have open:\n",

    "In case you've been living under a rock, allow us to introduce you to Taylor Swift, a famous singer, songwriter, and cultural icon. She has set all kinds of records in the music industry, including earning the most American Music Awards in history. She is also the number one most-streamed artist on Spotify, a digital music streaming service. \n",
    "\n",
    "With its origins in country music, Taylor Swift's style has evolved a lot since her 2006 debut album. In her most recent global concert tour, *The Eras Tour*, she guides fans through these musical \"eras\" in a three-hour performance which fans are paying thousands of dollars to attend. The film version of *The Eras Tour* became the highest-grossing concert film in history in just one weekend when it was released in October 2023.\n",

    "Chances are, you probably have heard some of Taylor Swift's songs; you might even know the words to all of them. In this project, we'll look at Taylor Swift's songs through the lens of data science. We have data on both the lyrics and audio qualities of Taylor Swift's musical body of work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets we will use contain all songs on each of Taylor Swift's [eleven studio albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_albums_discography#Studio_albums). We've chosen to use deluxe or extended versions of these albums when available, to include more songs, but we've eliminated duplicate versions of songs, such as acoustic versions and remixes. We've also chosen to include the rerecorded \"[Taylor's Version](https://www.vox.com/culture/22278732/taylor-swift-re-recording-1989-speak-now-enchanted-mine-master-rights-scooter-braun)\" when available. Our datasets don't include Taylor Swift songs that were released as part of movie soundtracks, live recordings, holiday specials, or through any other mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with two DataFrames throughout the project:\n",
    "- The `lyrics` DataFrame contains the lyrics of each Taylor Swift song.  The data in `lyrics` comes from [Genius](https://genius.com/), \"the world's biggest collection of song lyrics and crowdsourced musical knowledge.\"\n",
    "- The `tswift` DataFrame contains information about the audio features of each song. The data in `tswift` comes from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/). \n",

    "**Question 1.8.** Let's explore the relationship between different variables in the `tswift` dataset. Specifically:\n",
    "- `'Loudness'` is the average loudness of a track measured on a relative scale in decibels. Values typically range between -60 (softer) and 0 (louder).\n",
    "- `'Energy'` is a 0 to 1 scale of a track's activity and intensity, where higher values are more energetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, create a plot that shows the relationship between `'Loudness'` (on the horizontal axis) and `'Energy'` (on the vertical axis) in Taylor Swift's songs. Include an appropriate title. We've included some additional code to draw the best-fitting line to describe the relationship between these variables. We'll learn more about best-fitting lines when we study regression later in the course!"

Since we only have audio features for songs, not albums, we'll calculate the values of an audio feature for an album by averaging the values of that audio feature across all songs on the album. For example, to compute the `'Energy'` of the `'Midnights'` album, we would compute the mean `'Energy'` of all songs on the `'Midnights'` album.\n",

For example, `sort_albums_by('Energy')` would return an array whose first element is the name of the album with the highest mean `'Energy'` across all its songs.\n",

Complete the implementation of the function `select_top_recommendations`, which takes in an array `similarity_scores`, like the one you just created, and a positive integer `n`. The function should return a DataFrame of the `n` songs from `tswift` that correspond to the `n` **lowest** values in `similarity_scores`, sorted in increasing order of similarity score.\n",

    "implementation of the function `song_recommender`. The inputs to `song_recommender` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `input_uri`, the `'URI'` of a song which you want to find recommendations similar to.\n",
    "- `song_df`, a DataFrame that has a row corresponding to the song with the given `input_uri` and columns containing audio features.\n",
    "- `n`, the number of top-matching songs to be shown.\n",
    "- `feature_list`, a list of features to include in the similarity computation. This is an optional parameter; if not included, the similarity should be based on all features in `default_features`. \n",
    " \n",
    "The output should be an `n`-row DataFrame whose index contains `'URI'`s and whose only columns are `'Album'`, `'Song Name'`, and the columns included in `feature_list`. Each row in the returned DataFrame should correspond to a song; the songs should be sorted in decreasing order of similarity (that is, in increasing order of similarity score – the same way that the rows are ordered in the output of `select_top_recommendations`).\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:*** In the signature of the `song_recommender` function, we set `feature_list=default_features`. This tells Python that `feature_list` is an optional parameter, and if omitted, it should be set to `default_features`. We use functions with default parameter values all the time - for example, in the DataFrame method `.sort_values`, when we don't set the parameter `ascending`, it defaults to having a value of `True`. \n",

    "***Hints:***\n",
    "- You've done most of the work already. It's possible to solve this problem in one (long) line of code. We say this not to encourage you to write one long line of code, but to emphasize that you don't need to write a ton of code within the body of `song_recommender`.\n",
    "- The `+` symbol, when placed between two lists, concatenates the lists, just like when the `+` symbol is placed between two strings, it concatenates the strings. This will be useful when making sure that your output DataFrame has only certain columns.\n",

    "You may notice that for certain search terms, our search tool gives different results than the online search tool. There are a few reasons why. First, the set of songs we are searching is not exactly the same. Our `lyrics` DataFrame includes all the songs from Taylor Swift's studio albums, and the online search tool includes a few additional songs, like songs from movie soundtracks. \n",

    "Moreover, our search results always include matches where the search term is part of a longer word or phrase, like how `'plan'` is part of `'planets'`. The online search tool handles this more carefully, with options to search for an exact phrase, to include plurals, or to do a wilcard search which is similar to how we've chosen to implement the search. We'll stop here with our lyric searcher, but if you're interested in extending your lyric searcher further, you can try implementing some of these features from the online tool after you submit the project. There are lots of details to consider, such as how to pluralize words (it's not always as simple as adding an `'s'`)!"

    "Now that we've determined which words appear in the `'Lover'` album, we'll attempt to describe how important each word is to each song. To do this, we'll use a method from natural language processing called the **term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of TF-IDF is to measure how important a term is in a document relative to a collection of documents. In our case, terms are words, documents are songs, and the collection of documents we're interested in is the collection of songs on the album `'Lover'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a word,  $\\textbf{term}$,  in a document,  $\\textbf{doc}$, the TF-IDF of the word in the document is the product:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\\text{TF-IDF}(\\textbf{term}, \\textbf{doc}) &= \\text{TF}(\\textbf{term}, \\textbf{doc}) \\cdot \\text{IDF}(\\textbf{term}) \\\\\\ &= \\frac{\\text{number of occurrences of $\\textbf{term}$ in $\\textbf{doc}$}}{\\text{total number of words in $\\textbf{doc}$}} \\cdot \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\text{total number of documents}}{\\text{number of documents in which $\\textbf{term}$ appears}} \\right) \\end{align*} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the term frequency (TF) first. This is just the proportion of words in document $\\textbf{doc}$ that are equal to $\\textbf{term}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** What is the term frequency (TF) of \"Taylor\" in the following document?\n",

    "    - \"My friend named her baby <b>Taylor</b> because she is a huge <b>Taylor</b> Swift fan.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** $\\frac{2}{14}$, because two of the fourteen words in the document are \"Taylor\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that usually, a document will consist of an entire song, not just of a single line (like above).\n",

One way to think of the IDF is as a \"rarity factor\" – words that appear frequently in the full collection of documents are not very rare, and hence have low IDF, while words that rarely appear in the full collection of documents have high IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** What is the inverse document frequency (IDF) of \"Taylor\" in the following four documents?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"My friend named her baby <b>Taylor</b> because she is a huge <b>Taylor</b> Swift fan.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** $\\frac{2}{14} \\cdot \\ln \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\approx 0.041$, by multiplying the term frequency with the inverse document frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind TF-IDF is that for a word to be a good summary of a document, it should appear frequently in that document, but not too frequently in the full collection of documents. This means words like \"I\" or \"and\" won't have high TF-IDF, because while they may appear frequently in a document (high TF), they appear too often in general to be considered good summary words (low IDF).\n",

    "Imagine you wanted to calculate the TF-IDF for the word `'about'` in the song `'False God'`. You could do that by taking the code you just wrote and changing every instance of `'You Need To Calm Down'` to `'False God'`. Notice that you may get a different value for the term frequency (TF) because the word `'about'` may be more prevalent in one song than another. However, you'd get the same exact value for the inverse document frequency (IDF) because IDF is calculated based only the term (word) not the document (song), as we can see in the formula introduced earlier:\n",

    "This means that if we wanted to calculate the TF-IDF for the word `'about'` in *every* song on the `'Lover'` album, we could save some time and energy by just computing the IDF for `'about'` one time, in advance. Then for each song, we'd just need to calculate the TF of `'about'` in that song and multiply with the IDF for `'about'` that we'd already pre-computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next question, we'll pre-compute the IDF values for all words and store them in an array so that we can more easily compute TF-IDF values later.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Begin by storing all the words used on the album in an array called `word_array`. You should get these words from `counts_df`.\n",
    "1. Loop through this array, one word at a time, calculating the IDF, and storing the result in `idf_array`, which has been initialized to an empty array.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, `idf_array` should have the IDF values for every word on the album, in the same order that they appear in `counts_df`. That is, the first element of `idf_array` should be the IDF of `'16th'`."

    "Big congratulations on finishing the Midterm Project! 🎉 We hope this experience gave you a taste of what doing data science is really like: frustrating at times, but incredibly satisfying when you produce a finished product you're proud of! If you feeling like telling everyone you know about the cool song recommender you created or the beautiful word clouds you generated, that's a good sign!\n",
    "\n",
    "You're likely a stronger programmer and data scientist now than you were before you started this project, after all the effort you put into completing it. As a reminder of the growth you can achieve through hard work, and the fact that success does not come by accident, here's a spoof of Taylor Swift's song `'Mastermind'` about succeeding in DSC 10. \n",

    "As usual, follow these steps to submit your assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Select `Kernel -> Restart & Run All` to ensure that you have executed all cells, including the test cells.\n",
    "1. Read through the notebook to make sure everything is fine and all tests passed.\n",

    "1. Download your notebook using `File -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)`, then upload your notebook to Gradescope. \n",
    "1. If working with a partner, don't forget to add your partner as a group member on Gradescope!\n",
    "1. Stick around while the Gradescope autograder grades your work. Make sure you see that all tests have passed on Gradescope.\n",
    "1. Check that you have a confirmation email from Gradescope and save it as proof of your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "If running all the tests at once causes a test to fail that didn't fail when you ran the notebook in order, check to see if you changed a variable's value later in your code. Make sure to use new variable names instead of reusing ones that are used in the tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the tests here and on Gradescope just check the format of your answers. We will run correctness tests after the due date has passed."
