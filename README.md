# Data Science Portfolio

Selected data science projects demonstrating rigorous data analysis, statistical reasoning, data engineering, and clear communication through reproducible artifacts.

## Featured Projects

### League of Legends Gameplay Analysis: Wards vs. Dragons (DSC 80)
**End-to-end data science project with modeling and deployment**
- Data engineering and validation with explicit missingness analysis
- Hypothesis testing, predictive analysis, and subgroup diagnostics
